Algorithms taken from https://github.com/zingl/Bresenham

Put through https://c2rust.com/ then adapted to:
 - use rust types instead of libc types
 - take a function as argument to draw pixels
 - plot_quad_spline(): take a list of points instead of having
   to use unsafe pointer arithmetic for the point list

Only lightly tested

Did not include any of the aliased/thick functions.

The cubic functions need a bit of work to make them usable
from safe rust
